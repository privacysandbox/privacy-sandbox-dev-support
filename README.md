# Privacy Sandbox Developer Support

The Privacy Sandbox initiative aims to create technologies that both protect people's privacy online and give companies and developers tools to build thriving digital businesses. The Privacy Sandbox aims to help sites reduce cross-site and cross-app tracking while helping to keep online content and services free for all.

Learn more about the project on:

- Our overview site: [privacysandbox.com](https://privacysandbox.com)
- Our developer documentation: [developer.google.com/privacy-sandbox](https://developer.google.com/privacy-sandbox)

That said, documentation doesn't always answer every question and that's what this repo is for. If you have questions around developer issues relating to Privacy Sandbox or third-party cookies, you can raise an issue here to ask the team.

## Process

1. Take a look through the existing [issues](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/privacy-sandbox-dev-support/issues)
   to see if your issue has already been raised.
2. If not, [create a new issue](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/privacy-sandbox-dev-support/issues/new/choose)! Don't worry about getting it exactly right first time, it's just the start of the discussion.
3. Make sure you read the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct.md).

We respond to issues in a number of different ways:

* If your question is best raised as an issue against one of the Privacy Sandbox proposals, we'll point you to the right repository and help you pull together the specific details for the issue.
* If your question is actually an implementation issue, we'll point you to the relevant component on the browser's bug tracker (it doesn't have to be Chrome!) and we can help you get the specific details needed for the issue.
* If your question is already covered by existing documentation, we'll share the docs, and will try to understand the reasons why an answer to your question wasn't easily discovered or evident in the first place. We'll follow up with documentation updates if relevant.
* And, of course, if your question relates to what you need to specifically do on your site, then we can help work through a plan with you. We may use your question to create the first draft of documentation.

Your question may fall under several of these categories, and we may separate all those threads with you to get to the answers you need.

## Open issues in languages other than English

While the primary language for our Developer Relations team is English, we know that's not the case for all of our developers. We’ll use our best effort to understand issues opened in languages other than English, with the help of Google Translate. We will copy the translation into our comment, and respond in English.

If you have further feedback or questions, you can continue to reply to us in your preferred language, and we’ll follow this same protocol.

## Third-party cookie deprecation (3PCD) readiness list

We also use this repo as a location for different companies and organizations to share information about their work migrating from third-party cookies to alternative solutions.
