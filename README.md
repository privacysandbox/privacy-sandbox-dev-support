# Privacy Sandbox Developer Support

**Summary: ask your Privacy Sandbox developer questions in the [Discussions](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/privacy-sandbox-dev-support/discussions)!**

You can learn more about the Privacy Sandbox and associated projects at:

* [web.dev/digging-into-the-privacy-sandbox](https://web.dev/digging-into-the-privacy-sandbox/)
* [chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox)
* [privacysandbox.com](https://privacysandbox.com/)

These efforts are divided into three main areas:

1. 🧰 Replacing functionality served by cross-site tracking
2. 🍪 Phasing out third-party cookies
3. 🕶️ Mitigating workarounds

As these changes come to the web platform, and to Chrome and other browsers, it means
that you, as a web developer, will have changes to make to your sites. Either to
take advantage of new APIs or to ensure that you're taking into account
new restrictions.

Our aim is to land these changes with clear documentation and minimal disruption, but
it's likely you're going to have questions and we're here to try and answer
them! You can raise issues directly in this repo, and we'll also use this as a
location to collate questions and issues we hear from around the ecosystem.

## Process

1. Take a look through the existing [Discussions](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/privacy-sandbox-dev-support/discussions)
   to see if your issue has already been raised.
2. If not, create a new one! There are existing topics, but don't worry too much
   about picking the right one—we'll still answer.
3. Make sure you read the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct.md).

We will respond to your issues in a number of different ways:

* If your question is best raised as an issue against one of the Privacy Sandbox
  proposals, we will point you to the right repo and can help you pull together
  the specific details for the issue.
* If your question is actually an implementation issue, we will point you to the
  relevant component on the browser's bug tracker (it doesn't have to be Chrome!)
  and we can help you get the specific details needed for the issue.
* If your question is already covered by existing documentation, we will point
  you to that, but we will also try to understand the reasons why an answer to your 
  question wasn't easily discovered or evident in the first place. There's probably 
  something we can do to make the documentation better!
* And, of course, if your question relates to what you need to specifically do
  on your site—then we can help work through a plan with you. The aim is that
  we will use your question to create the first draft of documentation.

Your question may well cover several of these things in one, so we will also
separate all those threads with you to get to the answers you need.
